# AnalistasGPT
Desafio 2 para curso de Redes Generativas i2a2

Built with Streamlit front-end, this site emulates diferent psychotherapists. The initial idea was to use GPT3.5 to emulate ELIZA, the mother of all chat-bots. Then I had the idea to prompt diferent 'personas' to the GPT engine, so you can make your srink sessions with:
- ELIZA, the 1966 ELIZA chatbot,
- ELIZA 3.5 turbo, a Rogerian therapist, as original ELIZA, but with no 1960s tech restrictions,
- Pris, the self confident replicant from BLADE RUNNER
- Marvin, the Paranoid Android from the Hichiker's Guide to the Galaxy
- O Analista de Bagé, the rude south-brazilian shrink character from Luis Fernando Veríssimo (portuguese)
